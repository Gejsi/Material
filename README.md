## Summary

Slup was created by our desire for a performing UI framework following Material Design Guidelines.
So we started developing it with three core concepts in mind:

* High Performance
* Meticulousness
* Modularity

## Getting Started

Slup is divided in **packages**, which are basically Material Design Components: this means that you can rather install the entire framework or just the components that you'd like to use

### Installation

Slup can be installed whit **npm**
```
npm install --save @slup
```

or whit **yarn** ( We highly reccomend using it because it's much faster )
```
yarn add --dev @slup
```

## Built with

* [Inferno.js](https://infernojs.org/) - The React-like library used for creating components
* [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - The tool used for styling our components
* [Lerna.js](https://lernajs.io/) - The tool used for managing our multi-package framework
