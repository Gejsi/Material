> **NOTE: The library isn't complete yet**

Slup was created by our desire for a performing UI framework following strictly [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines). It packs lightweight components, based on the blazing-fast React-like library [Inferno](https://infernojs.org) and our own styling method inspired by the well known styled-component, but rewritten in a smaller and lightweight fashion. The speed and small size of our libraries provides some of the most goreous components in the design history with a lightweight and performant approach, perfect for your next PWA or web application. 

Plus we've also got an amazing support provided by [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)(the most loved `compile-to-javascript` language from the comminty)!

## Philosophy

* High Performance
* Meticulousness
* Beautiful and well commented(understandable) code
* Be as indipendent from other libraries as possible
* Enhance compatibility with other frameworks like (p)react [NOT YET]
* Small size and small footprint

## Getting Started

Slup is divided in **packages**: each pacakge represents a corresponding [Material Design component](https://material.io/guidelines/components), this means that each package can be found at `@slup/<package>` and installed separately improving both **size and speed** of your final bundle.
Here's how:

## Installation

Any slup package can be installed whit [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) as follows:
```bash
npm i -s @slup/<package>
```

## Running the demo
> NOTE: This process requires you to have installed [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) globally.

- To kick things off, clone the demo and enter that directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slupjs/slup && cd slup
```

- Install packages and run the demo:
```bash
lerna bootstrap # Install packages and symlinks
cd packages/Site # Go into the demo's site folder
yarn run compile:build # Build the javascritp SSR and client
yarn start # Start the demo server
```

## Development setup
> NOTE: This process requires you to have installed [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) globally.

- To kick things off, clone the demo and enter that directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slupjs/slup && cd slup
```

- Install packages:
```bash
lerna bootstrap # Install packages and symlinks
```

- Then move onto the demo's folder and start the watcher and the server:
```bash
cd packages/Site # Go into the demo's site folder

# In a first terminal: 
yarn run compile:watch # Bundle the application watching for changes

# In a second terminal:
yarn start # Start the demo server
```
