> **NOTE: The library isn't complete yet**

Slup was created by our desire for a performing UI framework following strictly [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines). It packs lightweight components, based on the blazing-fast React-like library [Inferno](https://infernojs.org) and the [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) UI library to provide easy theamability and fast rendering. This set of libraries makes us able to provide a complete asset of components


So we started developing it with three core concepts in mind:

* High Performance
* Meticulousness
* Tinily

## Getting Started

Slup is divided in **packages**: each pacakge represents a corresponding [Material Design component](https://material.io/guidelines/components), this means that each package can be found at `@slup/<package>` and installed separately improving both **size and speed** of your final bundle.
Here's how:

## Installation

Any slup package can be installed whit [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) as follows:
```
npm i -s @slup/<package>
```
